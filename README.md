# Green's Zen Browser collection
A list of fan projects I've made for (or related to) Zen Browser.

## [Zen Classic](https://github.com/greeeen-dev/zen-classic-mod)
Send your Zen Browser back to the 1.0.0-a days for a feeling of nostalgia. Tested on 1.0.1-a.22.

## [Arc Command Bar for Zen](https://github.com/greeeen-dev/zen-arc-cmd-bar)
> [!NOTE]
> This project is now natively integrated into Zen Browser!

A userchrome that tweaks Zen's URL bar to look more like Arc's when it's expanded. Available only for beta and Twilight versions.
